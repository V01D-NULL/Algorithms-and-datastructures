# Algorithms-and-datastructures

### Implemented:
- Singly linked list
- Queue using a doubly linked list (Amortized queue)
- vector (as in a dynamically resizable array, similar to C++'s std::vector)
- Deque using a vector

### Future ideas:
- circular buffer
- rb tree
- hashmap
- sorting algorithm(s) (I'm not sure which one, but I do want to add something like that)
